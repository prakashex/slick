## Technologies Used

- Next.js (13), Supabase, Stripe, Tailwind



Motivation

Goal was to build a full stack Sass app with SSR , payment proccessor integration and supabase

- backend apis handled by nextjs api routes
- frontend is written using pages router 
- uses stripe for payments
- for authenticaiton it uses Email auth provided by supabase
- uses postgres database provided by supabase to store user and client info

## Flow Overview
1. Capture user details using Stripe webhooks when the user pays for a plan.
2. Check if the user already exists in your system.
   - If the user exists, update their plan details.
   - If the user doesn't exist, proceed to the next step.
3. Create a new user using the Supabase auth API, passing the necessary user details.
4. Once the user creation is successful, create the user profile in the profile table by using a database function which triggers when every new user is created , and adds the user details in the profile table.
